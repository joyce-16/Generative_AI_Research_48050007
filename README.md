# Generative_AI_Research_48050007
This repository contains all the files and code related to the Generative AI Research project. The research explores cutting-edge advancements in generative AI techniques and their practical applications.

Main Branch: The main branch contains the finalised, merged code that has been reviewed and approved.

Branches: Each task or feature should be developed in a separate branch, and only merged into main after collaboration and final approval.

For each task or feature, start by creating a new branch from the main branch. Name the branch clearly. Do all your work in that branch and make sure youâ€™re working in the right folders to avoid mix-ups. When your branch is finished and reviewed, work with the team to merge it into main. Before you send a pull request, update your branch with the latest changes from main. Make sure to get any needed approvals before merging to avoid problems.

For any issues or collaboration requests, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
